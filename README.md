# AIO-EMU
An All-In-One Emulator website that contains all the up to date emulator for Windows, Linux, Android and MacOS.... EASY TO FIND 



Okay.. Website is completely made using A.I -> SORRY IN ADVANCE
But I did use my own commands and requests in order to create the design.... So should count as some sort of human intervention.

Back Story 
-------------------------------------------------------

So, I was finding it hard for myself and annoying that everytime a new emulator comes out or even an update, I have to go to browser, github then find the Repo and download the update. This is for almost for all standalone emulator. 

So I want to create something unique in which it would be easier for everyone to download directly from Emulator Creators' Github Repo.

This will be a static website.

If you wish to fork my project please do, and use a server to grab the latest version or even when a new version comes out, it will show on the website.
